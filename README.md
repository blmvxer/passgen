The Python version of this script will continue to be located on the repository but will no longer be updated in favor of the Julia port, If any new features arrive in the Julia port you wish to have in Python you are welcome to clone my repo and port it yourself.

#Changelog
This will be updated once we have fully finished the porting of the code and have the necessary features installed.

As of right now you can check the git changes.
